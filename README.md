# Mailing-API
I developed this API for Social Matte Media(A digital marketing company), which send a proposal to the clients using URL argument i.e. MAIL-ID of the client.

Problem: Being a small startup company, the Marketing team has to pitch their proposal to their potential clients via mail, but it was very problematic for them to copy the same content again and again and send to different emails at different points of time from company official mail id since there are many employees pitching the same thing and credentials cannot be shared to everyone in the team.

Solution : This project is a python flask framework based web-app, which send a particular mail(here, Proposal Brochure ) to the mails (of the client company) provided in the URL.

Usage: Put clients email ID here and hit enter
